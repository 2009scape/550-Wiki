If you don't agree with them, or any part, please don't use the Jagex product. Your use of a Jagex product is treated as an acceptance of the version of the terms and conditions in effect at the time of your use.</p>

<b>
A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT PRETEENS AND USERS UNDER 18</b><br>
If you are under 13 years old you will be able to create an account but unable to disclose personal data through the game or website. Any personal data collected by us, which we find subsequently to be from someone under 13, will be automatically deleted. We recommend that parents / guardians set up an account and play together with their children. Many parents have reported that playing Jagex Products as a family is fun and rewarding.</p>
<p>If you are under 13 and subscribe to the members' version of our game you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents / guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We reserve the right to permanently ban any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.</p>
<p>If you are under 18, by using our website you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents / guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and <a href="../../a=106/privacy/privacy.ws">privacy policy</a>. We reserve the right to permanently ban any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.</p>
<p>If we are notified by a parent that their child has lied about their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will terminate the account provided we have confirmation which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Parents can find more information about the Game and how to contact us in the <a href="http://www.jagex.com/l=0/corporate/Parents_Guide/parents_guide.ws" target="_blank">Parents' Guide</a>.</p>

It is particularly important to read the <a href="../../a=106/kbase/view.ws?guid=play_safely">Play Safely Guide</a> and the
<a href="../../a=106/kbase/view.ws?guid=play_safely#warning">Health & Safety Guide</a>.

<p>Whilst we reserve the right to monitor and take action upon inappropriate use of any Jagex Product (including the posting of inappropriate, offensive or otherwise objectionable material via the chat facility or otherwise), we cannot guarantee that any Jagex Product won't contain such content or that we will remove / modify any particular content. Nor can we guarantee that users will comply with our terms and conditions or otherwise behave appropriately.</p>
<p>If you are the victim of offensive or inappropriate behaviour or receive any other unwanted communications, you can use the built-in facilities to block the messages.
(See <a href="../../a=106/kbase/view.ws?guid=controls_friends">this article</a> for guidance on blocking messages.) You are able to report all inappropriate behaviour to us via the in game <a href="../../a=106/kbase/view.ws?guid=how_do_i_report_abuse">"Report abuse"</a> button.

Our rights</b><br>
If, acting reasonably, we consider that our terms and conditions have or may have been breached, or that it is necessary in order to prevent or stop any harm or damage to us, any Jagex Product, other players or the general public or to minimize our liability to others, we reserve the right with or - in appropriate cases - without prior notice to (amongst other things): Terminate (as defined above) or modify any or all accounts of Jagex Products which we think are connected with you and/or otherwise block your access to our websites and services and take such other steps as we consider reasonable. Such actions may result in loss of membership credit without refund <u>and/or loss of real money paid as part of any item / account trading or other prohibited transaction</u>.</p>
<p>For the purpose of preventing or remedying breach of our terms and conditions or any harm or damage to us, any Jagex Product, other players or the general public or to minimize our liability to others, we may in our absolute discretion automatically or manually monitor, censor (including rejection or removal of any content) and/or record public or private chat or other activities in any Jagex Product.</p>
<p>
<b>
Intellectual property rights</b><br>
Jagex�, RuneScape� and FunOrb� are registered trade marks of Jagex Limited in the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries.</p>
<p>You must not reverse-engineer, decompile or modify any Jagex Product client software in any way (except to the extent allowed by applicable law). You must not use a modified/customised version of the client software or attempt to sub-license it. You must not create or provide any other means by which any Jagex Product may be played by others (including, without limitation, replacement or modified client/server software, server emulators).</p>
<p>Materials (including without limit all information, software, data, text, photographs, graphics, sound and video) placed on any Jagex Product by us or on our behalf are protected by copyright and other intellectual property rights of ourselves or our business partners / suppliers / advertisers. You may not use these materials or any Jagex Product except in accordance with these terms and conditions and for personal (i.e. non-commercial) use only.</p>
<p>You agree that all intellectual property or other rights in any game character, account and items are and will remain our property.</p>
<p>By posting chat or other materials on any Jagex Product, you grant us a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty free, worldwide license to use and/or modify such materials on any Jagex Product as we see fit.</p>
<p>You agree that by submitting any material of any kind to us for any purpose connected with any Jagex Product (non-exhaustive examples are suggestions and ideas for any game or contributions to any Gallery page), you are giving us a non-exclusive, perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use and/or modify the submitted materials as we see fit. You agree that you will not withdraw the submission or attempt to make a charge for its use. Furthermore you guarantee that you are the exclusive copyright holder in relation to the submission and that the submission in no way breaches the rights of any other person or entity.</p>
<p>
<b>
Java OpenGL</b><br>
<p>RuneScape uses parts of the Java OpenGL (JOGL) library. We redistribute JOGL in binary form under <a href="../../a=106/terms/jogl.ws" target="_blank">this license</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>
Subscription</b><br>
Some parts of Jagex Products are subscription-based. If you apply for a subscription, you guarantee that all the information that you submit is true and accurate (including without limit your credit card number and expiration date, and other payment details) and that you have appropriate parental consent as applicable. You agree to pay all subscription fees specified when you apply including all applicable taxes. Unless otherwise stated, all prices shown for EU countries include VAT.</p>
<p>By submitting your order you are making an offer to subscribe to the relevant Jagex Product(s). Your offer is accepted and a binding contract occurs when we send a message to your account mail inbox confirming that your payment has been received or if you log into a subscribers-only part of a Jagex Product (whichever comes first).</p>
<p><u>All subscription payments will continue to be taken in advance at the relevant intervals (e.g. monthly in the case of monthly subscriptions) until you cancel your subscription (see below).</u></p>
<p>Payments by credit cards are also subject to our <a href="../../a=106/kbase/view.ws?guid=credit_card_payment#agreeing">credit card agreement</a> which forms part of these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to alter the amount or terms of our subscription fees at any time. If so, we will give notice by sending a message to your Game mail inbox (which you should check regularly) notifying you of the price change and at the same time posting a message which will be visible when you next log in to any Jagex Product. The change will not take effect for at least 30 days from the date when our message has been first accessed, thereby giving you an opportunity to cancel your subscription if you would prefer not to pay the new fee. If you do not cancel before the effective date, then the new fee will apply.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to charge you for any unauthorized use of your subscription by third parties.</p>
<p>
<b>
Cancellation by you</b><br>
You may cancel your subscription at any time by <a href="https://billing-core.funorb.com/a=106/unsubscribe.ws">clicking here</a> or selecting the "Cancel an Existing Subscription" or "Unsubscribe" link on the website of any Jagex Product.</p>
<p>Upon cancellation you will not be charged any further subscription fees. No payments already made will be refunded (wholly or partly) but you can of course use up any unused membership credit in the account.</p>

<b>
General</b><br>
Nothing in these terms and conditions affects your statutory rights as a consumer. Headings above are for guidance only and not binding. If we fail to enforce any provision of these terms and conditions, that failure will not preclude us from enforcing either that provision (or any similar provision) on a later occasion. If any provision of these terms and conditions is found by a court to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the court should endeavour to give effect to the parties' intentions as reflected in the provision and that other provisions remain in full force and effect.
