<b id="intro">1. Introduction</b>
<p>This website is owned and operated by Jagex Limited ("Jagex"), a company registered in England and Wales (registered number 3982706). Our registered office is at St John's Innovation Centre, Cowley Road, Cambridge, CB4 0WS, United Kingdom. Our VAT number is 791 951 784.</p>
<b id="definitions">2. Definitions</b>
<p>"Jagex Product(s)" is used as shorthand for our online games including all Jagex websites used to play those games and products published by Jagex on behalf of third parties. The ongoing supply of any particular Jagex Product is not guaranteed. Some Jagex Products have age restrictions.</p>
<p>References to "Stopping" or to "Stop" an account includes temporarily or permanently banning or muting an account. If your account is muted, you can continue to play but will not be able to use free text chat. If your account is banned, you will not be able to access your account and any licenses previously granted to you to use Jagex Products will be revoked. This means you will lose your account, characters and any in-game items or currency. Membership credit continues to expire if accounts are muted or banned.</p>
<p>"User Content" means all information of any kind (including text, images, video, information and messages) uploaded or sent by users on or in connection with Jagex Products.</p>
<b id="applicability">3. Applicability of the terms and conditions</b>
<p>Please read these terms and conditions carefully. Your accepting them in full is a condition of your use of a Jagex Product (whether or not you subscribe). If you don't agree with any part, please do not use the Jagex Product.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about these terms and conditions, please contact us via email at <img style="vertical-align: bottom" src="http://www.funorb.com/l=1/img/privacy/lawcontact.gif" alt=""/> and do not use the site until you are satisfied with and can accept these terms and conditions in full.</p>
<b id="changes">4. Changes to the terms and conditions</b>
<p>We may change these terms and conditions to reflect: (a) changes in applicable laws; (b) regulatory or security requirements; (c) relevant guidance or codes of practice; (d) technical alterations to Jagex Products; and (e) to improve clarity and consistency.</p>
<p>Please check the terms and conditions whenever you use a Jagex Product. If you are not a subscriber, we will treat your continued use of a Jagex Product as acceptance of these changes from their effective date as shown above. If you are a subscriber, we will treat the first renewal date of your subscription after the changes as your acceptance of the changes. If you do not agree with the changes you should cancel your subscription (as explained below) before the renewal date.</p>
<b id="underage_users">5. A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT Preteens And Users Under 18</b>
<p>Some Jagex Products may have age restrictions which prevent users under 13 creating an account. If a Jagex Product is not subject to age restrictions, a user under 13 may create an account. However, they must get consent from their parents/guardians to use the Jagex Product in accordance with our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given or that such consent does not comply with local laws regarding users who are under 13 years of age.</p>
<p>We do not knowingly collect or store any personally identifiable information from children under 13. If we find out that any personally identifiable information we have collected is from someone under 13, we will automatically delete it, and we may Stop the source account for that information.</p>
<p>We recommend that parents/guardians should play together with their children who are under the age of 13.</p>
<p>If you are under 18, by using our website you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents/guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and privacy policy. We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.</p>
<p>If we are told by a parent/guardian that their child has lied about their age when registering for Jagex Products, we will Stop the account provided we have information which satisfies us that the reporting person is indeed the parent or guardian.</p>
<p>Parents can find more information about Jagex Products and how to contact us in the <a href="http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/RuneScape_for_Parents" target="_blank">Parents' Guide</a>.</p>
<b id="safety">6. Safety and abuse</b>
<p>Before using any Jagex Product you should read Heath and Safety information and Safety and Security information. Parents of those under 18 should also review this information.</p>
<p>We are under no obligation to (and do not) monitor User Content. You should be aware of the potential risks of using a service which includes extensive User Content. User Content may be inaccurate, out of date or otherwise inappropriate. We cannot guarantee that users will comply with our terms and conditions, rules or otherwise behave appropriately. You should not assume that a person is who he or she claims to be. In your own interests, you should not attempt to contact any other user outside a Jagex Product.</p>
<p>If you are the victim of offensive or inappropriate behaviour or receive any other unwanted communications, you should use the built-in blocking facilities (as detailed in the Chatting and staying safe online section) to block the messages. You should report all inappropriate behaviour to us via the in game "Report abuse" button as well as seeking appropriate external help, for example from parents or law enforcement authorities. If you continue to suffer problems, or are not satisfied, then you must stop using the relevant Jagex Product(s).</p>
<b id="account">7. Your account and license</b>
<p>To use many features of Jagex Products, we require you to create an account and, in relation to some Jagex Products, download client software. We grant valid account holders a non-exclusive, non-transferable, personal, limited license, which can be revoked at any time, for the period of membership to use Jagex Products, to download and use our client software and to connect to our servers solely to use Jagex Products in accordance with these terms and conditions. The Jagex Products and any associated software are licensed, not sold. Your license confers no title or ownership to the Jagex Products or software.</p>
<p>You must not choose a username that infringes the rights of any third party, impersonates Jagex staff or other users, which is deliberately confusing, offensive, racist, obscene, hurtful, unlawful or otherwise inappropriate or which breaches the username requirements specified on our site or in our Rules of Conduct. We reserve the right to make such assessment in our sole discretion, change any username for any reason or take such other action as we believe appropriate.</p>
<p>You agree to keep your password safe at all times and not to disclose it to any other person. You are responsible for the activities of all persons who use your password to gain access to your account. To help ensure the safety of your password, you must keep your computer free of viruses and other malicious code including Trojans. You must use your password in accordance with the password requirements specified on our site and our Rules of Conduct. Real Jagex staff will never ask you for your password.</p>
<p>If you believe that someone has stolen your password or otherwise gained access to your account, you should submit an Account Recovery request via the Account Recovery link on the website of any Jagex Product and see our password guidance.</p>
<b id="intellectual_property">8. Intellectual property rights and ownership</b>
<p>Jagex&reg;, RuneScape&reg;, War of Legends&reg; and FunOrb&reg; are registered trade marks of Jagex Limited in the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries. All third party trade marks are the property of their respective owners.</p>
<p>You must not reverse-engineer, decompile or modify any Jagex Product client software in any way (except to the extent allowed by applicable law). You must not use a modified/customised version of the client software or attempt to copy, transfer or sub-license it. You must not create or provide any other means by which any Jagex Product may be played by others (including, without limitation, replacement or modified client/server software, server emulators). Please note that any such activity may constitute civil wrongs and/or criminal offences, and we reserve the right to take such action as appropriate in the circumstances should we become aware that such offences are being committed.</p>
<p>Materials (including without limit all information, software, data, text, photographs, graphics, sound and video) placed on any Jagex Product by us or on our behalf are protected by copyright and other intellectual property rights of ourselves or our business partners/suppliers/advertisers or licensors. You may not use these materials or any Jagex Product except in accordance with these terms and conditions and for personal (i.e. non-commercial) use only.</p>
<p>All intellectual property or other rights in any game character, account, content, virtual currency and virtual items in the Jagex Products are and will remain the property of Jagex and/or its licensors. You are only granted limited permission (which can be revoked at anytime) to use such content or Jagex Product, subject to and in accordance with these Terms and Conditions. The license granted herein confers no title or ownership in any Jagex Product or account and should not be construed as a sale of any rights to the Jagex Product.</p>
<p>NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY HEREIN, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU SHALL HAVE NO OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPERTY INTEREST IN ANY JAGEX PRODUCT OR ACCOUNT, AND YOU FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT ALL RIGHTS IN AND TO AN ACCOUNT ARE AND SHALL FOREVER BE OWNED BY AND INURE TO THE BENEFIT OF JAGEX.</p>
<p>Jagex does not recognise any purported: (a) transfers of virtual items which take place outside the rules of a Jagex Product; (b) transfers of accounts or virtual currency; or (c) sale, gift or trade in the real world of anything that appears or originates in a Jagex Product.</p>
<p>Jagex reserves the right to stop offering a Jagex Product or a particular part of a Jagex Product at any time either permanently or temporarily, at which point any license granted to you to use the Jagex Product or a part thereof will be automatically terminated or suspended. In such event, Jagex shall not be required to provide refunds, benefits or other compensation to users in connection with such discontinued elements of the Jagex Product.</p>
<b id="rules">9. Rules</b>
<p>You must comply with the current version of any rules, guidelines, codes of conduct or instructions specified in any Jagex Product including our game rules, the current version of which is linked to here.

<p>You will comply with and be bound by our policies relating to User Content, including our content standards policy below.</p>
<p>We reserve the right without notice or refund to record, suspend, remove or delete User Content or to disclose to the relevant authorities any User Content if: (a) it is the subject of a complaint; (b) if we consider that it breaches our terms and conditions (including our content standards policy); (c) if we consider that such steps are necessary to protect us or others; (d) a criminal act or civil wrong has been committed; or (e) we are required to do so by law or an appropriate authority.</p>

Your offer is accepted and a binding contract occurs when we send a message to your account mail inbox confirming that your payment has been received or if you log into a subscribers-only part of a Jagex Product (whichever comes first).</p>
<p><u>All subscription payments will continue to be taken in advance at the relevant intervals (e.g. monthly in the case of monthly subscriptions) until you cancel your subscription (see below).</u></p>
<p>Payments by credit/debit cards are also subject to our <a href="http://www.jagex.com/l=1/kbase/guid/paying_by_credit_card#agreement">credit card agreement</a> which forms part of these terms and conditions.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to alter the amount or terms of our subscription fees at any time. This will only apply to those who, following the change, take out new subscriptions or re-subscribe (their previous subscriptions having expired) and specifically agree to the new fees/terms.</p>
<p>We reserve the right to charge you for any unauthorized use of your subscription by third parties.</p>
<b id="cancelling">a. Cancelling your subscription</b>
<p>You may cancel your subscription at any time by clicking <a href="https://secure.funorb.com/m=billing_core/l=1/unsubscribe.ws">here</a> or selecting the "Cancel Subscription" link from the account management section on the website of any Jagex Product.</p>
<p>Upon cancellation you will not be charged any further subscription fees. No payments already made in respect of subscriptions or virtual currencies or items will be refunded (wholly or partly) but you can of course use up any unused membership credit in the account.</p>
<b id="distance_selling">b. Right to cancel under Distance Selling Regulations</b>
<p>If you are located in the EU, provided you have not started to use the subscription services by logging into a member's only world, you may cancel your order within 7 working days of placing it, in which case we will refund your subscription payment in full.</p>
<p>You may cancel by emailing <img style="vertical-align: bottom;display: inline;" src="http://www.funorb.com/l=1/img/privacy/billingsupport.gif" alt=""/> or by giving us written notice to our registered office (details can be found at the beginning of these terms and conditions).</p>
<p>If you log into a member's only world, you are accepting the contract and waive the 7 days cancellation period.</p>
<b id="virtual_currencies">14. Virtual currencies and virtual items</b>
<p>In certain Jagex Products, we offer virtual currencies for sale or, in our discretion, as free promotions. Virtual currencies can be redeemed (i.e. used) to acquire certain digital goods/services, which we describe below as "Items". If you obtain virtual currency, you must check that it has been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.</p>
<p>PLEASE TAKE NOTE that virtual currencies are subject to very important restrictions:</p>
<p>Virtual currency expires and will be deleted if it has not been redeemed within a certain period after acquisition, so you should redeem it as soon as possible. The expiry period is whatever we specify when you acquire the virtual currency or, if we haven't specified a time limit, twelve months from acquisition. </p>
<p>Unless we say otherwise on our website, virtual currency can only be redeemed within the world of the game where you acquired it. Each Jagex Product may contain one or more virtual currencies. We may at any time change or remove any Item which can be purchased using virtual currency, as well as change the amount of virtual currency needed to acquire a particular Item. You may only redeem virtual currency for Items on offer at the time of redemption.</p>
<p>Unless we say otherwise on our website, virtual currencies are specific to a particular Jagex Product, and one virtual currency used in relation to one Jagex Product may not be exchanged for another virtual currency for use in relation to another Jagex Product. In addition, unless otherwise stated, each virtual currency is independent and is not exchangeable for any other virtual currency in the same Jagex Product.</p>
<p>Virtual currency does not have any inherent value and is not your own private property. When you purchase or receive virtual currency, you do not own the virtual currency. Instead it constitutes a measurement of the extent of your license in a Jagex Product. Similarly, any virtual currency balance shown in your account does not constitute a real world balance or reflect any stored monetary value.</p>
<p>You can only use virtual currency to acquire those Items which we decide in our discretion to offer in return for virtual currency. We do not provide any cash or refunds for virtual currency (except as required by law) and virtual currency does not have any real world value. Virtual currency and Items are for your personal use only. You must not sell or transfer them or make them available to anyone else or attempt to do so, or encourage anyone else to do any of these things. Virtual currency and Items have no monetary value. Virtual currency and Items can never be redeemed for real world money, goods or any other item of monetary value. We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of virtual currency and Items. For example we may cap the amount of virtual currency which can be acquired or held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence. Certain Items may also only be available to certain persons, such as those who have separately acquired a subscription.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, virtual currency has no cash value, does not accrue interest and, unless otherwise required by law, is not redeemable or refundable for any sum of money or monetary value from Jagex at any time.</p>
<p>Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to, delete, reduce or liquidate virtual currency: (1) if you have misused the virtual currency or breached any of these terms and conditions; (2) if the virtual currency was awarded in error; (3) if a payment for virtual currency is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed; or (4) if you have used virtual currency to conduct any fraudulent or illegal activity.</p>
<p>Jagex reserves the right to restrict access to or delete virtual Items: (1) if you have misused the Items or breached any of these terms and conditions; (2) if the Items were purchased using virtual currency awarded in error; or (3) if a payment for virtual currency used to purchase the Items is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed. In addition, virtual Items that have been acquired by the redemption of virtual currency may expire after a period of time, which by default shall be twelve months from acquisition. In addition, Items may have particular restrictions, or be consumed or extinguished in the course of your use of Jagex Products.</p>
<p>We may at any time decide to end the entire virtual currency and Items program for all or any of our Jagex Products. Before we delete the unused virtual currency, we will endeavour to give you at least four weeks to redeem it.</p>
<b id="refund_policy">15. Refund policy</b>
<p>We are happy to review requests for refunds on a case by case basis. However, refunds are not always possible to give for many reasons.</p>
<p>Unless required by law, we will not refund any amounts paid in relation to subscriptions, in-game activities, virtual items or virtual currency when:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have been the victim of in-game scamming, as there are many warnings about avoiding this on the Jagex Products (however, we will do everything we reasonably can to assist you to recover your accounts).</li>
<li>You have been banned from a Jagex Product for violating these terms and conditions, any Rules of a Jagex Product or the user content policy.</li>
<li>Jagex stops offering the Jagex Product or you decide to cancel your subscription or account.</li>
</ul>
<p>If, after reading the above, you wish to request that we consider a refund, then please contact Billing Support for assistance, providing as much information as possible. Please note, refunds are given at the discretion of Jagex. If you are from the EU please also see "Right to cancel under Distance Selling Regulations" above.</p>
