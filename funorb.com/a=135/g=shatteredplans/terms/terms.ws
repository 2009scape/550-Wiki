<p align=right>Effective Date: 2nd April, 2012</p>
<p>
<b>Terms &amp; Conditions</b></p>
<p>
<b>Introduction</b><br/>

<p>
<b>Definitions</b><br/>
"Jagex Product(s)" is used as shorthand for our online games including all Jagex websites used to play those games.</p>
<p>References to "Stopping" an account include all or any of: locking, temporarily or permanently banning, or temporarily or permanently muting the account. If your account is muted, you can continue to play but will not be able to use free text chat. If your account is banned, you will not be able to access your account at all. NB Membership credit continues to expire if accounts are muted or banned.</p>
<p>
"User Content" means all information of any kind (including text, images, video, information and messages) uploaded or sent by users on or in connection with Jagex Products.</p>
<p>
<b>Applicability</b><br/>
Please read these terms and conditions carefully. Your accepting them in full is a condition of your use of a Jagex Product (whether or not you subscribe). If you don't agree with any part, please don't accept them or use the Jagex Product.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about these terms and conditions, please contact us via email at <img style="vertical-align: bottom" src="../../../img/privacy/lawcontact.gif" alt=""/> and do not use the site until you are satisfied with and can accept these terms and conditions in full.</p>
<p>
<b>Changes</b><br/>
We may change these terms and conditions to reflect: changes in applicable laws; regulatory or security requirements; relevant guidance or codes of practice; technical alterations to Jagex Products; and to improve clarity and consistency. Please check the terms and conditions whenever you use a Jagex Product. If you are not a subscriber, we will treat your continued use of a Jagex Product as acceptance of these changes from their effective date as shown above. If you are a subscriber, we will treat you as bound by the changes on the first renewal date for your subscription after the effective date and so you should cancel your subscription (as explained below) before this renewal date if you don't like the proposed changes.</p>
<p>
<b>A SPECIAL NOTE ABOUT PRETEENS AND USERS UNDER 18</b><br/>
Jagex Products are not targeted to users under 13 years of age. If you are under 13 years of age, from 24 November 2010 you will not be permitted to create an account for any of these products. If you are under 13 years of age and created an account prior to November 24, 2010, you will be allowed to continue playing with the limitations placed on users under 13 years of age as explained below.</p>
<p>
If you are under 13 we may be able to direct you to other products that may be suitable for you. If you are under 13 and created an account prior to 24 November 2010, you will be unable to disclose personal data through the game or website. If we find out that any personal data we have collected is from someone under 13, we will automatically delete it. We recommend that, for existing accounts, parents / guardians should play together with their children.
<p>
If you are under 13, have created an account prior 24 November 2010 and subscribe to the members' version of our game you are representing (i.e. making a promise) that you have consent from your parents / guardian to use Jagex Products in accordance with our terms and conditions and <a href="http://www.jagex.com/a=135/g=shatteredplans/privacy/privacy.ws">privacy policy</a>.

We may Stop any account if we are not satisfied that such consent has been given.</p>

Virtual currencies can be redeemed (ie used) to acquire certain digital goods / services, which we describe below as "Items". If you obtain virtual currency, you must check that it has been correctly credited to your account and tell us immediately if not.</p>
<p>
PLEASE TAKE NOTE that virtual currencies are subject to very important restrictions:</p>
<p>
Virtual currency expires and will be deleted if it has not been redeemed within a certain period after acquisition so you should redeem it as soon as possible. The expiry period is whatever we specify when you acquire the virtual currency or, if we haven't specified a time limit, three months from acquisition.</p>
<p>
Unless we say otherwise on our website, virtual currency can only be redeemed within the world of the game where you acquired it. Each game may contain one or more virtual currencies. We may at any time change or remove any or any type of Item for which virtual currency can be redeemed as well as the amount of virtual currency needed to acquire a particular Item. You may only redeem virtual currency for Items on offer at the time of redemption. Unless we say otherwise on our website, virtual currencies are specific to a particular Jagex Product, and one virtual currency used in relation to one Jagex Product may not be exchanged for another virtual currency for use in relation to another Jagex Product. In addition, unless otherwise stated, each virtual currency is independent and is not exchangeable for any other virtual currency in the same Jagex Product.</p>
<p>
Virtual currency does not have any inherent value and is not your own private property. You can only use them to acquire those Items which we decide in our discretion to offer in return for virtual currency. We do not provide any cash or refunds for virtual currency (except as required by law) and virtual currency does not have any real-world value. Virtual currency is for your personal use only. You must not sell or transfer it or make it available to anyone else or attempt to do so or encourage anyone else to do any of these things. Virtual currency and Items have no monetary value. Virtual currency and Items can never be redeemed for real world money, goods or any other item of monetary value. We may impose additional restrictions concerning the acquisition or redemption of virtual currency and Items. For example we may cap the amount of virtual currency which can be acquired or held or redeemed in any particular period or we may impose restrictions based on your country of residence. Certain Items may also only be available to certain persons, such as those who have separately acquired a subscription.</p>
<p>
<p>
We may restrict access to or delete virtual currency or Items: (1) as outlined under "Our Rights" above; (2) if the virtual currency was awarded in error; or (3) if a payment for virtual currency is charged back or otherwise cancelled or reversed.</p>
<p>
We may at any time decide to end the entire virtual currency program for all or any of our games. Before we delete the unused virtual currency, we will endeavour to give you at least four weeks to redeem it.</p>
